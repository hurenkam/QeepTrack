        <p>
        The goal of QeepTrack is to provide an outdoor GPS experience on your smartphone or tablet. It has two basic views, a MapView that makes use of public online mapping services like OpenStreetMaps to show map data, allows for setting out a route, and measure distances. Additionally it has a Dashboard view that aims to make available all types of data an outdoor enthusiast might be interested in, this includes speed, altitude, distance measurements, as well as heading, bearing to waypoint, time to waypoint, current time.

        The application runs on iPhone 6s, and iPad 3 (probably works fine on most IOS platforms), however it is not available in the app store. This is because to make it available one needs to subscribe to the apple development program, which costs about a 100 dollars a year. Since i provide this software under an open source license, it would mean i have to pay for other people to use my program for free. This is a step too far for me, and thus i provide it here, complete with sources, so that anyone who wants to can build it and use it on their own devices. If you would like to see this in the app store, feel free to make a donation, once i receive enough donations to join the developers program, I'll make it available in the app store.

        Currently, the app is untested on android platforms. I did run it in the emulator, and it seems to work fine there. Feel free to make a donation if you like to see this run on your hardware. I'll use whatever hardware i have available to improve the app.
